## Background

There is a belief that the effectiveness of the anti-angiogenesis agent TFD725 (evaluated in the **nsclc** dataset) may be different for older vs younger patients. We will use the nsclc dataset to attempt to evaluate this.

## Analysis

(1) As a first pass, we will consider a few subgroups of patients: Those 50 and older (50+), 55+, 60+, 65+, and 70+. Please estimate/evaluate the probability a patient on TFD725+docetaxel will survive past 400 days in each of those subgroups. Please also give an interval estimate for each of those probabilities.

```{r question-1}
# create a factor variable from patient age
nsclc$age2 <- cut(nsclc$age, 
                  c(seq(50,70,5), max(nsclc$age)), include.lowest = TRUE,
                  labels = c("50+","55+","60+","65+","70+"))
# remove the few observations whose age was below 50 (their age2 is NA)
nsclc <- subset(nsclc, !is.na(age2))
table(nsclc$age2) # number of patients within each group
# there are too few patients aged 70+ for it to be a suitable category

# perform logistic regression to estimate the age-specific treatment effects
mod.lr <- glm(survival.past.400 ~ tx*age2, data=nsclc, family=binomial())
coef(mod.lr)
# confint(mod.lr)
```

2) Now, in each of those subgroups evaluate whether TFD725+docetaxel is more effective than docetaxel alone (and the magnitude of any potential treatment effect). In addition, evaluate if the treatment effect appears to substantively and/or systematically differ across age (or if the data doesnâ€™t give a clear answer to this).

```{r question-2}
